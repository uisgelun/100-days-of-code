# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some Javascript exercises on FCC (up to *Adding a default option in Switch statements*)

**Thoughts:** Feeling like a complete noob but I hope I will soon know enough to start my own projects! I am enjoying the process immensely!
