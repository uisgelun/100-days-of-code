# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some Javascript exercises on FCC (up to *Adding a default option in Switch statements*)

**Thoughts:** Feeling like a complete noob but I hope I will soon know enough to start my own projects! I am enjoying the process immensely!



### Day 2: July 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with FCC's Javascript tutorial (up to *Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript*)

**Thoughts:** Significantly less done in comparison to yesterday, but then again, the exercises were tougher today and much more interesting.

### Day 3: July 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Done with Object Oriented and Functional Programming.

**Thoughts:** I had a good pace, worked on the JS exercises until bed time.

### Day 4: July 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Basic Algorithm Scripting and completed about half of the problems.

**Thoughts:** Lost a day on the 27th, but got back at it more determined to make it. The algorithms were easy enough, but I noticed I was way to eager to read through the hints without putting significant effort first.

### Day 5: July 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some more Basic Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts:** It was a very tiring day, but I managed to put some coding in, albeit nothing note-worthy. Still, I did my coding and I can see a neat little habit forming :)

### Day 6: July 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with FCC's Javascript tutorial up to *Seek and Destroy*.

**Thoughts:** Today I avoided looking at the hints for as long as possible. Got stuck at the Seek and Destroy algorithm for ever, but did not look for the answer anyway. Ended up learning many little details of the language and actually managed to solve it myself by the end of the day. I was really satisfied with myself, despite the slow progress!

### Day 7: July 31st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally done with the Basic Algorithms! Decided to go back to the beginning and do the HTML/CSS portion of the Front End Certificate before the JSON APIs and AJAX.

**Thoughts:** Decided to go back to the beginning and do the HTML/CSS portion of the Front End Certificate before the JSON APIs and AJAX and complete the 'easier projects' before diving into the more complex ones.
